## General Info

Exodus map is a fan-made map that aims to reimagine events post Far Cry 2 campaign.
Map is still in the development state and features plenty of abandoned places, urban and rural areas.

The idea is to built an open map for upto 16 players to scavage and compete, as well as some smaller modes for single-player experience.

## Map Locations (at the moment)

* Twin Peaks
* Industrial Compound
* Dogon
* Trainyard
* Border

## Get Hands On

* Make sure Far Cry 2 is installed on your machine
* Download the [map](https://github.com/MirzaLeka/Exodus-Map-FC2/tree/master/map)
